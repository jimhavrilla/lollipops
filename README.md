lollipops
---------

A simple 'lollipop' mutation diagram generator that tries to make things
simple and easy by automating as much as possible. It uses the
[Pfam API](http://pfam.xfam.org/help#tabview=tab9) to retrieve domains and
colors, and the [BioMart API](http://www.biomart.org/) to translate HGNC
Gene Symbols into Uniprot/SwissProt Accession number. If variant changes
are provided, it will also annotate them to the diagram using the
"lollipops" markers that give the tool it's name.

Example
-------

    ./lollipops TP53  E343Q R342Q F338 R335C R283H R283C R282W R248Q G245S C242 N235S P223H P222 P222L V216 R213 L206 L194 D186E S185 S185N R158 R156H Y107H

Results in the following SVG image:

![TP53 Lollipop diagram with 3 marked mutations](tp53.png?raw=true)

Usage
-----

Usage: ``lollipops [options] GENE_SYMBOL [PROTEIN CHANGES ...]``

Where ``GENE_SYMBOL`` is the official HGNC symbol and ``PROTEIN CHANGES``
is a list of amino acid changes of the format "(amino-code)(position)..."
Amino-code can be either the 1- or 3-character code for the amino acid.
Only the first position in each change is used for plotting even if the
change contains a range. All characters after the position are ignored.

    -o=out.svg         SVG output filename (default GENE_SYMBOL.svg)
    -labels            draw labels for each mutation
    -hide-axis         do not draw the aa position axis
    -hide-disordered   do not draw disordered regions
    -hide-motifs       do not draw motifs
    -w=700             SVG output width (default=automatic)

If you are working with non-human data, or know the Uniprot Accession
already, You can specify it with `-U UNIPROTID` instead of GENE_SYMBOL,
for example the following mouse query works for gene `Mobp`:

    ./lollipops -U Q9D2P8
